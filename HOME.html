      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        <br>Dr. Richard Frenneaux offers a distinctive blend of academia and a notable background in the music industry. With significant contributions as the principal songwriter, frontman, and producer for Sony signed band, Red Light Company, he achieved commercial success, propelling their album Fine Fascination to the 13th spot on the UK Album charts. Red Light Company embarked on several tours, headlining their own shows while supporting high-profile acts such as the Kaiser Chiefs, Editors, Kasabian, The Killers, U2, Coldplay, and Snow Patrol. <br>
        <br> The band received strong support from influential music outlets. Zane Lowe named their track "Arts & Crafts" the "Hottest Record in the World", and multiple singles from their album were B-listed on BBC Radio 1. Red Light Company was featured on several "Bands to Watch" lists, including those of NME and HMV, with additional endorsements from Edith Bowman of BBC Radio 1. Their single "Scheme Eugene" was named The Sun’s "Single of the Week," beating out tracks from artists like Britney Spears and Leona Lewis. <br>
        <br> Notably, as a writer and producer, Dr. Frenneaux's collaborations with renowned artists such as Lana Del Rey and Natasha Bedingfield, alongside production maestro Flood, resulted in a 2 x Gold Record, demonstrating his far-reaching impact on the music industry. <br>
        <br> Frenneaux has worked with rising talents like Essex singer-songwriter Joseph J. Jones, co-writing and producing his material. After Jones' single "Gospel Truth" spent over three months in the German Top 100 airplay chart and earned him an Anchor Award nomination, his follow-up track "Crawl" gained further momentum. It entered the German Top 150 airplay chart, appeared on Spotify’s New Music Friday playlists in ten markets, and hit viral charts in the UK, France, Italy, Austria, and Ireland, receiving airplay on BBC Radio 1, Capital Xtra, and Radio X. In addition, Dr. Frenneaux collaborated with Laura Welsh, whose music found critical and commercial success in both charts and film with a noteable contribution to the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack. Together, they produced and wrote an EP that charted in the Top 10 on the US iTunes Chart. <br>
        <br> In 2023, Dr. Frenneaux transitioned to academia, assuming the role of Assistant Professor in International Communications at the University of Nottingham Ningbo Campus in China. His research includes notable works such as "A New Paradigm of Engagement for the Socially Distanced Artist" (2021) and "The Rise of Independent Artists and the Paradox of Democratisation in the Digital Age" (2023).
